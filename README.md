# Getting Started

A system of product recommendations was created based on a dataset provided, which contained the product purchases from a wide range of clients. The system itself takes a client ID, and returns a list of recommended products. Two different algorithms are offered: The first is a collaborative based filtering method, which creates a rank for each product purchased by each client; the second is a content based method using NLP to detect similarity between product titles. The resulting recommendations are provided with a categorical weighted average.
Keywords: Collaborative filtering, item based, Artificial Intelligence
